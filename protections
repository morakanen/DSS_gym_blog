Security Headers (security.js):
javascript
CopyInsert
helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", 'https://hcaptcha.com'],
    // ...
  }
})
What: Defines which resources can be loaded and from where
Protects Against:
XSS attacks by controlling script sources
Clickjacking by preventing iframe embedding
Data injection by restricting resource origins
Man-in-the-middle attacks by enforcing HTTPS
Input Sanitization (sanitize.js):
javascript
CopyInsert
const DOMPurify = createDOMPurify(window);
export const sanitizeInput = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.body) {
    Object.keys(req.body).forEach(key => {
      if (typeof req.body[key] === 'string') {
        req.body[key] = DOMPurify.sanitize(req.body[key].trim());
      }
    });
  }
}
What: Cleans user input by removing malicious HTML/JavaScript
Protects Against:
XSS attacks in user content
HTML injection
JavaScript injection
Malformed input attacks
Error Handler (errorHandler.js):
javascript
CopyInsert
export const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  const message = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
    ? err.message 
    : 'An error occurred';
  // ...
}
What: Centralizes error handling and hides sensitive details
Protects Against:
Information leakage through error messages
Stack trace exposure
System information disclosure
Path disclosure vulnerabilities
Test Controller Updates:
javascript
CopyInsert
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT NOW()`;
res.json({ 
  message: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
    ? 'Connected to Railway PostgreSQL'
    : 'Database connection successful'
});
What: Replaces raw queries with Prisma and hides implementation details
Protects Against:
SQL injection attacks
Database information disclosure
System information leakage
Version number exposure
Rate Limiting (rateLimit.js):
javascript
CopyInsert
export const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5 // 5 attempts per window
});
What: Limits the number of requests from an IP
Protects Against:
Brute force attacks
DoS attacks
Credential stuffing
Password spraying
Added Security Dependencies:
json
CopyInsert
{
  "dompurify": "^3.0.8",
  "helmet": "^8.1.0",
  "xss": "^1.0.14"
}
What: Added specialized security libraries
Protects Against:
dompurify: HTML-based XSS attacks
helmet: Various HTTP vulnerabilities
xss: Cross-site scripting attacks
Permissions Policy Header:
javascript
CopyInsert
res.setHeader('Permissions-Policy', 
  'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()');
What: Controls browser feature permissions
Protects Against:
Unauthorized feature access
Privacy violations
Sensor access abuse
Location tracking
Content Security Directives:
javascript
CopyInsert
scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", 'https://hcaptcha.com'],
styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
What: Fine-grained control over resource loading
Protects Against:
Remote script injection
Unauthorized resource loading
Mixed content vulnerabilities
Data exfiltration
These security measures work together to create multiple layers of protection:

Prevention: Headers and CSP prevent attacks
Sanitization: Clean input before processing
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse and brute force
Error Handling: Hide sensitive information
Monitoring: Track and log security events
This defense-in-depth approach means that even if one security measure fails, others are still in place to protect the application.
